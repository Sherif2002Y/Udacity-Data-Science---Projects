# **World Development Indicators**

## Project Motivation

For this project I was interested in conducting exploratory data analysis following the follow the CRISP-DM process on the World Development Indicators Dataset which can be found [here.](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators)

The questions that i will be answering are as follows:

- Q1. What are the top 5 factors most positively associated with higher life expectancy?
- Q2. What is the historical trend of global energy consumption per capita between 2010-2020?
- Q3. Which five countries had the highest total energy consumption per capita from 2010 to 2020?

The link to my Jupyter notebook code and all relevent EDA analysis will be found [Here](https://github.com/Sherif2002Y/Udacity-Data-Science---Projects/blob/main/Project%201/World%20Development%20Indicators.ipynb)

## Blog Post
My main findings gethered on my notebook can be found on the blog i wrote Medium and can be accessed  [here](https://medium.com/@sherifyasser19/3-global-secrets-that-define-life-expectancy-and-the-year-the-world-paused-bb590b52dd12).
