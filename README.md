## Project 1: Introduction to Data Science - World Development Indicators

This project follows the CRISP-DM process to demonstrate my data science skills and communicate insights effectively.
I chose the World Development Indicators dataset out of personal interest to explore global socioeconomic trends 
and understand the factors that drive development and influence policy decisions.
