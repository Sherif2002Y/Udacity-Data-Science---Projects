# Udacity Data Science - Projects
This repo contains projects that I have worked on for the [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) Data Scientist Nanodegree program

## Project 1: Introduction to Data Science - World Development Indicators

This project follows the CRISP-DM process to demonstrate my data science skills and communicate insights effectively.
I chose the World Development Indicators dataset out of personal interest to explore global socioeconomic trends 
and understand the factors that drive development and influence policy decisions.

## Project 2: Data Science Dashboard

### Project Overview
In this project, I acted as a Data Scientist for a manufacturing company to address concerns regarding employee turnover. The goal was to build a functional dashboard for managers to monitor team productivity and the risk of employees being recruited by competitors.

## Project 3: Data Science Pipeline

**Project Overview:**
I developed a machine learning pipeline to predict if a customer would recommend a product (Recommended IND) by analyzing a mix of customer demographics, product categories, and written feedback.

**Key Technical Points:**
* Mixed Feature Integration: Processed Numerical data (Age, Positive Feedback Count), Categorical data (Division, Department, Class), and Text data (Review Text, Title).
* NLP Text Mining: Transformed unstructured customer reviews into numerical features to capture sentiment and product quality indicators.
* Automated Workflow: Built a Scikit-Learn Pipeline to handle preprocessing and modeling in one seamless flow, ensuring data consistency.
* Business Impact: Created a tool to automatically flag product recommendations even when the user leaves the recommendation field blank.
