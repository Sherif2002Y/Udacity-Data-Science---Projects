# Udacity Data Science - Projects
This repo contains projects that i have worked on for the [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) Data Scientist Nanodegree program

## Project 1: Introduction to Data Science - World Development Indicators

This project follows the CRISP-DM process to demonstrate my data science skills and communicate insights effectively.
I chose the World Development Indicators dataset out of personal interest to explore global socioeconomic trends 
and understand the factors that drive development and influence policy decisions.

## Project 2: Data Science Dashboard

### Project Overview
In this project, I acted as a Data Scientist for a manufacturing company to address concerns regarding employee turnover. The goal was to build a functional dashboard for managers to monitor team productivity and the risk of employees being recruited by competitors.


### Business Scenario
Upper management noticed a trend of losing top talent. To mitigate this, I developed a solution that:
* **Tracks Performance:** Visualizes positive and negative performance events recorded by managers.
* **Predicts Retention Risk:** Integrates a machine learning model that calculates the likelihood of an employee being recruited elsewhere.
* **Supports Decision Making:** Provides managers with a clear view of both individual and team-wide metrics.

### Technical Implementation
This project required a blend of software engineering and data science best practices:

1.  **SQL & Data Layer:** Developed complex SQL queries to extract business-critical datasets from the `employee_events` database.
2.  **Python Packaging (OOP):** Built a custom Python package using **Object-Oriented Programming** to create an API-like interface, allowing other teams to access data without writing manual queries.
3.  **FastHTML Dashboard:** Extended an existing codebase to build an interactive dashboard. This involved customizing pre-built Python classes to meet specific business requirements.

### Key Features
* **Individual & Team Views:** Toggle between a single employee's data or a team's average performance.
* **Recruitment Risk Metric:** Real-time display of recruitment likelihood scores.
* **Scalable Architecture:** Followed the company's internal standards for API publishing and repository structure.
